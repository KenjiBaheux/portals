# Portals
Portals is a very early proposal for enabling seamless navigations between sites or pages. In particular, this proposal enables a page to show another page as an inset and perform a seamless transition between an inset state and a navigated state.

See the **[explainer](https://github.com/WICG/portals/blob/master/explainer.md)**.

See the **[early draft spec](https://wicg.github.io/portals/)**.
